In this project we are creating a simple REST API which will be used to create, read, update and delete from a Postgres database (at the point of writing this document an export of the database is attached to the project).

To start the REST_API (Sinatra app) on the Terminal go to the project root and do:
```ruby
  ruby launcher.rb
```
This will start the Webrick server on localhost 4567.
